1. Take stock of your progress on Unit 5 - if you were on track, you should have completed Lesson 5: Building an App - Clicker Game before school was shut down.
1. Make a plan for completing the unit by late April (the College Board allows 12 hours for the Create Task, which is roughly 5 weeks at 2.5 hours per day, so we will be launching the Create Task on the 23rd of April).

1. Submit a link to your journal once you have completed your plan.
